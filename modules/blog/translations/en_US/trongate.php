    'trongate.summary' => <<<'TEXT'
Trongate is often misunderstood and gets a bad reputation because it breaks with common standards and takes a journey back to its roots. 
In this article, I will explore and highlight this rough diamond that deserves a spot in the limelight.
TEXT,
    'trongate.intro' => 'An exciting PHP framework that challenges the established standards and offers a simple yet effective approach to development.',
    'trongate.tagline' => <<<'TEXT'
I have worked with PHP for {{phpExpYears}} years, and one recurring thing is <underline>unnecessary</underline> code that needs maintenance. 
Occam's razor is clearly visible when all you want is to tear <underline>everything</underline> out by the roots and start fresh, hoping to build something more simple.
TEXT,
    'trongate.mhavc' => "This is where Trongate shines; you get a simple starting point with a solid starting architecture due to everything being divided into modules, including media and JavaScript files.",
    'trongate.missing_i18n' => <<<'TEXT'
A criticism that could be made is that internationalization (i18n) hasn't been considered, and there is actually no real language support. 
This is true and something I have <pr-link>previously</pr-link> addressed. It's on the roadmap, and I look forward to seeing how it gets resolved. :)
TEXT,
    'trongate.callback_validation' => 'Another feature that often flies under the radar is <u>callback</u> based validation.',
    'trongate.hope' => "My hope with this article is to spark people's interest and highlight a rough diamond that unfortunately has gained a somewhat bad reputation.",
    'trongate.before_i_go' => 'Before I go, I just want to shout out',
    'trongate.mx' => '<div>A library based on <a href="https://htmx.org">HTMX</a> and in many ways has the same features, just using mx- instead of hx-.</div>',
    'trongate.mx_more' => <<<'TEXT'
<div>And yet it offers so much more, with close integration, built-in modal support, <a href="https://trongate.io/docs/trongate-mx/managing-ui-during-requests.html">"optimistic" UI</a>, and <a href="https://trongate.io/docs/trongate-mx/after-swap-operations.html">more</a>.</div>
